Incident Response: 

# Intrusion detection? This is a checklist of suspicious events:

- Mysterious open ports, strange processes.

- System utilities (common commands) behaving strange.

- Login problems.

- Unexplained bandwidth usage.

- Damaged or missing log files, syslog daemon behaving strange.

- Interfaces in unusual modes.

- Unexpectedly modified configuration files.

- Strange entries in shell history files.

- Unidentified temporary files.

# Recovering from intrusion? Take the following actions in this order:

- Disconnect the machine from the network.

- Try to find out as much as you can about how your security was breached.

- Backup important non-system data. If possible, check these data against existing backups, made before the system was compromised, to ensure data integrity.

- Re-install the system.

- Use new passwords.

- Restore from system and data backups.

- Apply all available updates.

- Re-examine the system: block off unnecessary services, check firewall rules and other access policies.

- Reconnect.
